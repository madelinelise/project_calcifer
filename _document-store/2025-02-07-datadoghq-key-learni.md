We’ve just released the 2024State of Cloud Security study, where we analyzed
the security posture of thousands of organizations using AWS, Azure, and
Google Cloud. In particular, we found that:

  * Long-lived cloud credentials continue to be problematic and expose cloud identities.
  * Adoption of IMDSv2 in AWS is rising, though still insufficient.
  * Use of public access blocks on storage buckets varies across cloud platforms and is more prevalent in AWS than Azure.
  * A number of cloud workloads have non-administrator permissions that still allow them to access sensitive data or escalate their privileges.
  * A number of managed Kubernetes clusters across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud are directly exposed to the internet and have nodes with risky permissions.
  * Most cloud incidents are caused by compromised cloud credentials.
  * Insecure IAM roles for third-party integrations can leave AWS accounts at risk of exposure.

In this post, we provide key recommendations based on these findings, and we
explain how you can use Datadog Cloud Security Management (CSM) to improve
your security posture.

## Minimize the use of long-lived cloud credentials

Credentials are considered long-lived if they are static (i.e., never change)
and also never expire. These types of credentials are responsible for a number
of documented cloud data breaches, and organizations should avoid using them.

In AWS, this means you should avoid using IAM users. Using IAM users to
authenticate humans is both cumbersome and risky, especially in multi-account
environments. AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) and IAM role
federation provide a more secure and convenient way of managing and
provisioning human identities, while supporting common command-line
applications such as the AWS CLI or Terraform.

AWS workloads—such as EC2 instances—should not use IAM users either. Depending
on the compute service in use, AWS provides mechanisms to leverage short-lived
credentials by design, so applications can transparently retrieve short-lived
credentials without additional effort when using the AWS SDKs or CLI. These
mechanisms include:

  * IAM roles for EC2 instances
  * Lambda functions execution roles
  * IAM roles for EKS service accounts
  * IAM roles for ECS tasks
  * CodeBuild service roles

You can also use a service control policy (SCP) to proactively block the
creation of IAM users at the account or organization level.

In Google Cloud, humans should leverage their own identity—typically from
Google Workspace—and should not authenticate to the Google Cloud APIs using
service account keys.

Google Cloud Workloads should not use service account keys, as they don’t
expire and can easily become exposed. Instead, you can attach service accounts
to workload resources, such as virtual machines or cloud functions. For the
common case of workloads running in a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster,
you can leverage Workload Identity to transparently pass short-lived
credentials for a specific service account to your applications. Google Cloud
also provides several organization policy constraints that you can enable at
the project, folder, or organization level to disable service account or
service account key creation.

In Azure, users accessing resources should authenticate using their Entra ID
identity. They should not use long-lived credentials of Entra ID applications.
Similarly, Azure workloads such as virtual machines should not embed static
credentials of an Entra ID application. Instead, you can leverage Managed
Identities to transparently and dynamically retrieve short-lived credentials
bound to a specific app registration. Services running in Azure Kubernetes
Service (AKS) can use Entra Workload ID.

### Using Datadog CSM to identify long-lived cloud credentials

You can use the Inventory in Datadog CSM to identify IAM users and Google
Cloud service accounts or service account keys across all your cloud
environments.

You can use the CSM Inventory to identify long-lived cloud accounts, as well
as their associated misconfigurations and related threats.

The cloud configuration rule “Service accounts should only use GCP-managed
keys” (open in-app) also allows you to quickly identify Google Cloud service
accounts with active user-managed access keys.

## Track down stale cloud credentials

As discussed above, long-lived cloud credentials are problematic because they
never expire and can become exposed in places such as source code, container
images, configuration files, etc. Older credentials carry an even greater
risk. Consequently, tracking down old and unused cloud credentials is a highly
valuable investment for security teams. You can use an AWS credential report
to identify IAM users with unused credentials. In Azure, you can use the
Microsoft Graph API through the Azure CLI to identify all Azure AD
applications with credentials and pinpoint old ones:

    
    
    az rest --uri 
    'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/?$select=id,displayName,
    passwordCredentials'
    

In Google Cloud, you can use Policy Analyzer to retrieve the last
authentication time of every service account and identify unused ones:

    
    
    gcloud policy-intelligence query-activity \
      --activity-type=serviceAccountLastAuthentication \
      --project=your-project
    

It’s also possible to use Recommender, including at the organization level.

### Use Datadog CSM to track down stale cloud credentials

With Datadog CSM, you can identify stale and risky cloud credentials at scale.
In particular, you can use the following rules:

  * AWS: “IAM access keys that are inactive and older than 1 year should be removed” (open in-app)
  * AWS: “Access keys should be rotated every 90 days or less” (open in-app)
  * Google Cloud: “Service accounts should rotate user-managed or external keys every 90 days or less” (open in-app)

## Enforce the use of IMDSv2 on Amazon EC2 instances

The EC2 Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) is designed to help
protect applications from server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities.
By default, newly created EC2 instances allow using both the vulnerable IMDSv1
and the more secure IMDSv2. It’s critical that EC2 instances—especially
publicly exposed ones hosting web applications—enforce IMDSv2 to protect
against this type of vulnerability, as SSRF vulnerabilities are frequently
exploited by attackers.

AWS has released a guide to help organizations transition to IMDSv2, as well
as a blog post about the topic. Several additional mechanisms are also
available:

  * A mechanism to enforce IMDSv2 by default on specific Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), released in 2022
  * A set of more secure defaults for EC2 instances started from the console, released in 2023
  * A mechanism to enforce IMDSv2 by default at a regional level, released in 2024 (Datadog implemented support for this mechanism in the Terraform AWS provider)

While it’s more efficient to enforce IMDSv2 at the design phase—for instance,
by updating the source infrastructure-as-code templates—it’s also possible as
a last resort to use an SCP to block access to credentials retrieved using
IMDSv1.

### Use Datadog CSM to identify EC2 instances that don’t enforce IMDSv2

You can use Datadog CSM to identify EC2 instances that don’t enforce IMDSv2
through the Misconfigurations rule “EC2 instances should enforce IMDSv2” (open
in-app) and the CSM Issue “Publicly accessible EC2 instance uses IMDSv1” (open
in-app).

In addition, the attack path “Publicly accessible EC2 host is running IMDSv1
and has an SSRF vulnerability” (open in-app) allows you to easily identify
instances that are immediately at risk.

Datadog CSM identifies an EC2 instance that's publicly accessible and does not
have IMDSv2 enforced.

## Block public access proactively on cloud storage services

Cloud storage services such as Amazon S3 or Azure storage are highly popular
and were among the earliest public cloud offerings. While storage buckets are
private by default, they are frequently made public inadvertently, exposing
sensitive data to the outside world. Thankfully, cloud providers have
mechanisms to proactively protect these buckets, ensuring that a human error
doesn’t turn into a data breach.

In AWS, S3 Block Public Access allows you to prevent past and future S3
buckets from being made public, either at the bucket or account level. It’s
recommended that you turn this feature on at the account level and ensure this
configuration is part of your standard account provisioning process. It’s
important to note that since April 2023, AWS blocks public access by default
for newly created buckets. However, this doesn’t cover buckets that have been
created before this date.

A similar mechanism exists in Azure, through the “allow blob public access”
parameter of storage accounts. Similarly to AWS, all Azure storage accounts
created after November 2023 block public access by default. Microsoft,
however, planned to migrate to a more secure default in November 2023.

In Google Cloud, you can block public access to Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
buckets at the bucket, project, folder, or organization level using the
“public access prevention” organization policy constraint.

When you need to expose a storage bucket publicly for legitimate reasons—for
instance, hosting static web assets—it’s typically more cost-effective and
performant to use a content delivery network (CDN) such as Amazon CloudFront
or Azure CDN rather than directly exposing the bucket publicly.

### Use Datadog CSM to identify vulnerable cloud storage buckets

You can use Datadog CSM to identify vulnerable cloud storage buckets through
the following rules:

  * “S3 bucket contents should only be accessible by authorized principals” (open in-app)
  * “S3 buckets should have the ‘Block Public Access’ feature enabled” (open in-app)
  * “S3 bucket ACLs should block public write actions” (open in-app)
  * “Blob Containers anonymous access should be restricted” (open in-app)
  * “Cloud Storage Bucket should not be anonymously or publicly accessible” (open in-app)

Datadog also determines when a storage bucket is publicly accessible, and
allows you to filter associated misconfigurations, so you can focus on the
ones that matter most.

You can also manually select or deselect public accessibility as a facet in
the CSM sidebar.

## Limit privileges assigned to cloud workloads

Cloud workloads such as virtual machines are frequently assigned permissions
to perform their usual tasks, such as reading data from a cloud storage bucket
or writing to a database. However, overprivileged workloads can allow an
attacker to access a wide range of sensitive data in the cloud environment—or
even gain full access to it. Ensuring that workloads follow the principle of
least privilege is critical to help minimize the impact of a compromised
application.

Right-sizing permissions is a continuous process that usually follows three
steps:

  1. Determine what actions the workload needs to perform.
  2. Apply the associated policy to the workload role, with minimally scoped permissions. For instance, if an EC2 instance needs to read files from an S3 bucket, it should only be able to access this specific bucket.
  3. Avoid “permissions drift” by ensuring that the workload still requires and actively uses these permissions.

At development time, you can use tools like iamlive to discover what cloud
permissions a workload needs. At runtime, cloud provider tools such as Amazon
IAM Access Analyzer or Google Cloud Policy Intelligence can compare granted
permissions with effective usage, to suggest scoping down permissions of
specific policies. Note that Google decided to make Policy Intelligence
accessible only to organizations that use Security Command Center at the
organization level, instead of providing it as part of their base offering,
starting January 2024.

In addition, it’s important to note that seemingly innocuous permissions can
allow an attacker to gain full access to a cloud account through privilege
escalation. For instance, while the AWS-managed policy
AWSMarketplaceFullAccess may give the impression it’s only granting access to
the AWS Marketplace, it also allows an attacker to gain full administrator
access to the account by launching an EC2 instance and assigning it a
privileged role.

### Use Datadog CSM to identify overprivileged cloud workloads

You can use the following CSM Misconfiguration rules to identify risky
workloads:

  * AWS: “EC2 instance should not have a highly privileged IAM role attached to it” (open in-app)
  * AWS: “Publicly accessible EC2 instances should not have highly-privileged IAM roles” (open in-app)
  * AWS: “Lambda functions should not be configured with a privileged execution role” (open in-app)
  * Google Cloud: “Instances should be configured to use a non-default service account with restricted API access” (open in-app)

In addition to showing you a detailed context graph, Datadog CSM also
indicates the “blast radius” of the impacted workload—i.e., further resources
that can be accessed if the instance is compromised.

## Apply cloud-specific tuning to your managed Kubernetes clusters

Managed Kubernetes services like Amazon EKS, Azure AKS, and Google Cloud GKE
are widely adopted in cloud environments, enabling teams to concentrate on
deploying application workloads rather than handling the complexities of
Kubernetes control plane management. Despite their popularity, these clusters
often come with insecure default configurations. This can pose significant
risks, as these clusters operate within cloud environments; compromising a
managed cluster can provide attackers with pathways to access the underlying
cloud infrastructure.

In general, it’s important to make sure of the following when working with
managed clusters:

  1. Limit internet exposure. This can typically be achieved by allow-listing IP ranges, using a site-to-site VPN tunnel, or a zero-trust solution such as Google Cloud’s Identity-Aware Proxy (IaP), which is fully compatible with GKE.
  2. Ensure that proper logging is enabled. On Amazon EKS, audit logs are not enabled by default and require explicit configuration.
  3. Block pod access to the worker node’s metadata service. On EKS and AKS, this is typically done through a Kubernetes network policy. On GKE, this requires turning on Workload Identity.

### Use Datadog CSM to identify risky managed Kubernetes clusters

You can use the following CSM Misconfigurations rules to identify risky
managed clusters in your cloud environment:

  * “EKS clusters should have audit logs enabled” (open in-app)
  * “EKS Cluster should have public access limited” (open in-app)
  * “GKE clusters should have monitoring and logging enabled” (open in-app)
  * “Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine cluster should not be publicly accessible” (open in-app)
  * “AKS Cluster should have public access limited” (open in-app)

## Secure IAM roles used for third-party integrations

Third-party SaaS services often integrate with cloud environments. The most
common way of doing so is through the use of IAM roles. In this situation,
customers of that service create an IAM role with a trust relationship to a
specific, vendor-owned AWS account.

This increases the risk of “confused deputy” attacks, where any third party
with knowledge of your AWS account ID could enroll your account on the third-
party SaaS service. To prevent this type of threat, it’s essential to enforce
the use of an ExternalID, an identifier known only by the user and the third-
party SaaS solution.

It’s also critical to make sure that your role does not have excessive
permissions with regards to what the third-party service needs to accomplish.
For instance, a role used to read CloudTrail logs should not have permissions
to read data from S3 buckets. Otherwise, if the role is compromised (such as
through the lack of an ExternalID) or the third-party SaaS service is
breached, an attacker would get access to sensitive data.

### Use Datadog CSM to identify risky third-party roles

You can use Datadog CSM to identify overprivileged third-party roles, as well
as roles that have excessive permissions.

  * “AWS IAM role with external cross-account trust relationship does not use an external ID” (open in-app)
  * “AWS IAM role has a large permissions gap” (open in-app)

You can also use a custom query in the CSM Misconfigurations explorer to
identify roles matching both of these rules:

    
    
    @workflow.rule.defaultRuleId:(def-000-qaw OR def-000-au9) 
    

Finally, CSM Identity risks allows you to visually identify unused permissions
and suggest a right-sized policy, based on correlation with CloudTrail logs
and IAM Access Analyzer.

## Secure your infrastructure against common cloud risks

Our 2024 State of Cloud Security study shows organizations have made continued
improvements from 2023 when it comes to securely configuring their cloud
infrastructure. Still, there is work to be done in several key areas—these
include avoiding long-lived and unmanaged credentials, using the most up-to-
date and secure configurations on compute and storage instances, and ensuring
roles are not overprivileged, particularly those associated with third-party
SaaS integrations. In this post, we highlighted several steps that teams can
take to harden their security posture on these fronts, and they can use
Datadog CSM to help in that effort.
